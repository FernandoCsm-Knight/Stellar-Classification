# Repository for Stellar Classification Models and Validation
## Authors: Fernando Campos Silva Dal' Maria & Julia Veloso Dias 

Welcome to the Stellar-Classification repository, the home for our machine learning models dedicated to the task of stellar classification. This repository includes sophisticated models like MLP, Random Forest, SVC, and Bagging, each fine-tuned to strike a balance between true positive rates and false positive rates, as evidenced by their ROC curves and AUC scores.

Here, you'll find the complete code for implementing these models, performing cross-validation, and conducting T-tests to statistically validate their performance. We've meticulously crafted each model to ensure robustness and reliability in classifying celestial objects.

Whether you're an astrophysicist, a data scientist, or someone passionate about the cosmos and machine learning, this repository provides you with a set of powerful tools for stellar classification. Dive into our code, explore the nuances of each model's performance, and contribute to the exciting field of astronomical data analysis.
